Electron is a powerful framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies. One of the common customizations developers often want to implement is a custom title bar. This can give your application a unique look and feel, and better integrate with your app’s design. In this post, we’ll walk through the steps to create a custom title bar for your Electron app.


## Step 1: Set Up Your Electron Project
First, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, create a new Electron project:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
